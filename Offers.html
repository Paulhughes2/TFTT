Fortunately, we are one of the few that provide professional care for reptiles and exotic pets. We offer regular visits for your pet, this includes heat, light and humidity checks, feeding and cleaning per your instructions.

Your dog will spend his/her days out of the city. We take pride in giving our dogs great exercise while giving them the time of their lives out with their friends. We accommodate all dogs needs whether young, elder, small or large. We frequent beaches, trails and parks where dogs can truly be themselves. Previous days out have included the beach, Kinver edge, many of the national trust’s gardens, the woods and many more. The pups come home tired, fulfilled, and well behaved. We photograph every hike!
