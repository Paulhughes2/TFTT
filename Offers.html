            <h4>Reptiles</h4>
            <p class ="cardinfo">Our reptile sitting services are available for one-off emergencies and for longer-term care. We can either come to your house and do some reptile-sitting, or we occasionally board them if they are housed correctly & easily transportable. As with all pet owners, those with reptiles want the best care for their pets—but they also face the unique challenge of finding others well versed in their pets’ specific needs. Fortunately, we are one of the few that provide professional care for reptiles and exotic pets. We offer regular visits for your pet, this includes heat, light and humidity checks, feeding and cleaning per your instructions. Regular customers include; snakes, lizards, dragons, skinks, monitors, iguanas, tortoises, terrapins, turtles and geckos.</p>

            <h4>Adventure Days</h4>
            <p class ="cardinfo">Our adventure program consists of a full day of fun in the country. We handpick each dog's day out based on your pup's personality and recall abilities. Your dog will spend his/her days out of the city. We take pride in giving our dogs great exercise while giving them the time of their lives out with their friends. We accommodate all dogs needs whether young, elder, small or large. We frequent beaches, trails and parks where dogs can truly be themselves. Previous days out have included the beach, Kinver edge, many of the national trust’s gardens, the woods and many more. The pups come home tired, fulfilled, and well behaved. We photograph every hike!

            <h4>Cats</h4>
            <p class ="cardinfo">We love caring for cats! Cats are creatures of habit and are much happier staying at home in their own familiar "territory".  We will come to your home and lovingly provide all the essentials your cat(s) will need including: food, water, litter box cleaning, brushing, play time, and TLC!  After each visit you will receive an email report with visit notes and a picture.  For the safety or your cats, we recommend at least one visit per day while you are gone.</p>
